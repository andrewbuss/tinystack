tinystack: a stack-based microcode

Tinystack's distinguishing feature is its short instruction length - 4 bits.
Tinystack's memory is arranged as 32768 words of 2 bytes each. By packing 4
instructions per word, it's possible to spend only one of every four cycles
fetching instructions from memory. The first three instructions of each word
may load values from or store values in memory, but the fourth is reserved
for fetching the next set of instructions.

Tinystack is big-endian - the nibbles 4 5 b f represent the number 0x45bf

Tinystack contains two stacks, the second of which is called the stash.
The stash can hold general-purpose data but arithmetic can only be performed
on the top two elements of the stack. Data can be moved between the stack and
the stash with the save and rstor instructions.

By convention, the top of the stack and the element below it are sometimes
referred to as x and y respectively.

Stack manipulation instructions:

    swap    - swap the top two stack elements    1 2 -> 2 1
    dup     - duplicate the top stack element:   1 2 -> 1 2 2
    disc    - discard the top stack element      1 2 -> 1
    save    - remove the top stack element and push it onto the stash
    rstor   - remove the top stash element and push it onto the stack
    pushl   - push literal nibble

              Sequential pushl's build up a constant at the top of the stack
              nibble by nibble, from least significant to most significant.
              A command that isn't a pushl interrupts this, and when four
              nibbles have been pushed, the next call to pushl will start the
              sequence again.

              pushl 3 -> 0x0003                  pushl 5 -> 0x0005
              pushl 5 -> 0x0053                  pushl 6 -> 0x0065
              dup     -> 0x0053 0x0053           pushl 4 -> 0x0465
              pushl 2 -> 0x0053 0x0053 0x0002    pushl 2 -> 0x2465
              pushl 0 -> 0x0053 0x0053 0x0002    pushl 7 -> 0x2465 0x0007

Arithmetic instructions:

    add     - add the top two stack elements and leave the result on the stack
              4 5 -> 9           65500 100 -> 64    (mod 2^16)
    mul     - multiply the top two stack elements and leave the result there
              4 5 -> 20          65500 100 -> 61936 (mod 2^16)
    xor     - bitwise-xor the top two stack elements and leave the result there
              4 5 -> 1           65500 100 -> 65464
    and, or - behavior can be deduced from name
    neg     - replace the top of the stack with its additive inverse mod 2^16
              6 -> 65530             65529 -> 7
    sign    - replace the top of the stack with:
                  0xFFFF == 65535 == -1 if the sign bit of x is set (x & 0x8000)
                  0 otherwise

Memory instructions:

        There are some details about how these handle writing to byte addresses
        despite memory arranged in words, but they will be written up later.

        Memory operations cannot occur as the last instruction of a word.

    ld      - acts like "x = *x". Replaces the top value with the value at the
              address to which it points.
    st      - acts like "*x = y; x += 2". Stores the second value at the
              address pointed to by the top of the stack. Then, adds 2 to
              the value at the top of the stack.

Control flow:
    skip    - pop an offset from the top of the stack and jump forward by
              that many bytes. Then, push the current instruction address
              plus 1 onto the stack. A skip instruction cannot occur in the
              last instruction of a word.

              After a skip instruction is executed, the instruction following
              it will also be executed. Then program flow will continue
              where requested.

              If the top of the stack is zero, this has no effect (apart from
              discarding the top value)

And that's it. This is definitely Turing-complete but organizing useful
programs requires careful attention to the layout of the stack and stash.
A sample program to compute the Fibonacci sequence is included as fib.s, and
its assembled version is included as fib.tsb.

Run this with:
